## Yonsei Mansa
* Through my experience in the Mansa club, I've been exposed to various activity about comic. This experience led me to realize that comic can be an art form that combines literature and visual arts. And in Mansa, while reading comic, I often took time to contemplate the author's intended message and the values they wished to convey.

* My experience in Mansa wasn't limited to reading comics. The club offered various gatherings where I had the opportunity to meet diverse people and engage in a wide range of activities such as traveling, cooking, and cocktail tasting.

## Duration
* March 2023 ~ June 2023
