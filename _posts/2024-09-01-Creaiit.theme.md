## Creai+IT
* This is a club that engages in start-up using AI. We identify problems in our surroundings, assess business viability through interviews and market research, and develop business plans and MVPs. Through weekly sessions and study groups, we learn about start-ups, design, and AI. We also form teams to participate in various start-up competitions.

* The projects I conducted in this club are as follows:
	* Gen-AI Utilization Competition: This is a contest to create solutions that address local problems using Generative AI. We are currently developing a service to solve the issue of local government notices not being effectively communicated to people. We have begun creating an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for this service.

	* 2024 Yonsei University Student Startup Competition: This is the largest project I'm currently involved in. It's a competition where we develop and present actual startup ideas with business potential. Our team is developing a service to solve the problem of unnecessarily prolonged meetings. We have completed the project proposal and business plan.
