## Yonsei NEXON RC Creative platform
* I participated in a program hosted by Yonsei University and Nexon. As part of this program, we formed teams to identify problems in our surroundings. We then conceptualized services to address these problems and created Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) which were exhibited.

* Through various lectures and meetings, we learned how to conduct market research, interview people, and effectively identify problems. We successfully completed the project using these methods.

## Duration
*  April 2023 ~ October 2023
