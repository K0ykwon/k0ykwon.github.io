## Information Security Camp
* From August 2024, I worked as an assistant instructor for a hacking security course at a high school. My role was to support the main instructor, an information security expert from Hana Bank. The course ran for four sessions, with each session lasting three hours on Saturdays.

* The hacking study I did at YCC was very helpful for this activity. It was an excellent opportunity to learn more deeply about information security and gain a better understanding while working alongside an expert.

## Duration
* August 2024 ~ September 2024
