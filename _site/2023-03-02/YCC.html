<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This club was where I learned the most about computers and had the opportunity to participate in various activities. Through diverse studies and projects, I was able to build knowledge and experience, which greatly helped me in my major studies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The projects I conducted in this club are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>VR Archery Game: We created a game using HMD tracking technology in Unity, allowing players to move in virtual space and shoot moving targets with a bow. I designed the game not just as a simple target-shooting score game, but as a defense-style game where players can achieve objectives and feel a sense of accomplishment.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>3D Pixel-Based Sandbox Game: I created a game by cloning Minecraft’s block placement and destruction logic, allowing players to create desired works in a 3D space. Additionally, I implemented interactions between blocks, enabling the creation of circuits such as AND and NOT gates. Using these features, I implemented a simple bit calculator and confirmed its proper functioning.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The studies Participated in the club are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>Hacking and Security Study: We learned various hacking techniques and methods to defend against them. We practiced these skills using the ‘DreamHack’ website.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
